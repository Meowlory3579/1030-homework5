            <h2>What Makes Travel Special?</h2>
            <p>
                Traveling is about exploring new places and cultures, tasting unfamiliar foods, and seeing the world
                from fresh perspectives. It builds empathy and turns geography into lived experience. Planning the route
                and finding your way in a new city can feel like a fun puzzle - one that rewards <b>curiosity and
                    flexibility</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it’s a quick road trip or a long international adventure, the memories you bring home are
                often worth <u> far more</u> than the souvenirs. It's a <i>transformative</i> experience that has
                expanded my worldview, grown my confidence, and deepened by understanding of myself.
